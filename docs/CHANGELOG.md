# Update notes

## 1.1.0

*I probably should've used 1.1 for Woolhaven update but I forgot.*

- Added fallback for role that do not have icons in the font (ex. some of the new DLC roles like logistics)  
so they instead use the icon for their command

## 1.0.3

- Fixed compatibility with Woolhaven update

## 1.0.2

- Not an actual mod update: just a hotfix for mod page images (I need to increase the mod version for this)

## 1.0.1

- Fixed resurrection menu not working as intended

## 1.0.0

- Initial release
